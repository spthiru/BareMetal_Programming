about ADC:
---------
     Analog-to-Digital converters (ADC) translate analog signals,
real world signals like temperature, pressure, voltage, current, distance, or light intensity, 
into a digital representation of that signal.
This digital representation can then be processed, manipulated, computed, transmitted or stored.

Acquisition time:
----------------
  Acquisition time (sampling time) is the time required for the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) to capture the input voltage during sampling.
The acquisition time of a Successive Approximation Register (SAR) ADC is the amount of time required to charge
the holding capacitor (CHOLD) on the front end of an ADC.


///////////////////ADC Configuration steps in stm32////////////////

step 1  : enable ADC clock
step 2  : set anolog input pin to analog mode
step 3  : clear the CR1 register(it's there in the adc register).
step 4  : enable A/D converter
step 5  : set resolution value for our requriedments.
step 6  : set conversion mode to single.
step 7  : start the regular conversion. 
step 8  : set data allignment for right.
step 9  : select channel sample time to 15 cycles.

step 10 : again start conversion. 
step 11 : untill wait for EOC bit set as 1
step 12 : read the data to ADC_DR register.
